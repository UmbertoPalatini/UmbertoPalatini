- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @UmbertoPalatini, a postdoctoral associate at The Rockefeller University in New York.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in tropical and emerging infectious diseases spread by arthropod vectors, with a emphasis on arboviruses. Mosquito competence for arboviruses is a complex and evolving phenotype that depends on the interaction between RNA viruses. mosquito vectors and the environment. I use molecular biotechnology, genetic engineering and bioinformatics to investigate biology of vector-mediated pathogen transmission, with a focus on mosquito behavior, olfaction and host seeking mechanisms.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact me using my Rockefeller University email: upalatini@rockefeller.edu
